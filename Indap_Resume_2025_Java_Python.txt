Senior Software Engineer – Java Backend & Platform Modernization
Capital One | May 2021 – Present
* Modernized an ecosystem of 80+ Spring Boot services by leading the upgrade from 1.5.x → 2.7.x, eliminating 2000+ critical and high vulnerabilities, improving performance, and bringing the platform into long-term support compliance.
* Accelerated streaming platform modernization by contributing to the Kafka SDP migration (legacy → newer version), driving configuration alignment, refactoring service integrations, and establishing a validated testing strategy for seamless adoption.
* Improved data quality and system interoperability by performing schema transformations and dataset registrations, flattening complex legacy structures to enable clean ingestion and downstream analytics.
* Increased reliability and reduced regressions by implementing comprehensive ATDD testing with JUnit, Mockito, and Cucumber, strengthening the service-level test matrix across critical microservices.
* Strengthened release assurance by driving non-prod testing, validation, and final production readiness checks across multiple microservices during major migration cycles.
* Reduced operational noise and improved service stability by proactively monitoring distributed systems using Splunk and CloudWatch, performing rapid root-cause analysis and resolving release- and environment-related issues.
* Partnered with repository-owner teams during PR reviews to ensure alignment with internal coding, security, and operational guidelines.
* Uplifted team competency and delivery speed by conducting knowledge-transfer sessions on SDP migration, testing strategy, and release verification workflows adopted by both new and senior team members.
* Worked with Java microservices that interacted with DynamoDB-backed components, contributing to troubleshooting, integration validation, and AWS SDK–based service communication.
* Streamlined migration and release coordination for 40+ services by maintaining structured trackers for PR status, test validation, and production readiness.
* Enabled reliable cross-environment delivery by collaborating with platform, DevOps, data, and SRE teams to troubleshoot complex environment issues and coordinate multi-region deployments.
Senior Software Engineer – Python Automation & Cloud Deployment (Gear Application Project)
Capital One | May 2021 – Present
* Enhanced and stabilized an internal Python-based Gear deployment platform integrated with Jenkins CI/CD, improving automation reliability for containerized rollouts on AWS ECS, ALB, and VPC networks.
* Reduced deployment failure rates from ~9% to below 5% by instrumenting intelligent error diagnostics in Python using Boto3 and internal libraries, surfacing root-cause–specific guidance directly in Jenkins logs.
* Improved operational safety by implementing Python-based IAM role validation that prevented misconfigured releases (e.g., wrong environment roles), reducing pipeline rollbacks and wasted developer cycles.
* Accelerated triage time by adding automated CloudWatch deep-links in Jenkins, enabling one-click navigation to ECS task logs; this cut debugging effort from hours to minutes for common deployment failures.
* Strengthened container security and compliance by building GitHub PR pre-checks (TypeScript) that enforced monthly Docker base-image updates, preventing outdated or vulnerable images from entering production pipelines.
* Modernized internal infrastructure tooling by leading the migration of Bogiefile v1 → v2 using AWS Lambda and Step Functions, automating configuration merging and ensuring backward compatibility across an ecosystem of 1,600+ services that relied on the Gear deployment platform.
* Increased team capability and autonomy by mentoring engineers new to Python, sharing best practices for AWS automation and CI/CD debugging, and delivering knowledge-transfer sessions adopted across the team.
Java Full-Stack Developer
Charter Communications | Jan 2020 – May 2021
* Designed and developed microservices and REST APIs using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud, integrated with Angular 8 front-end components for full-stack delivery.
* Implemented Spring Data JPA for database persistence and optimized queries for PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
* Developed Kafka producers and consumers for asynchronous communication between services.
* Automated builds and deployments using Jenkins pipelines and containerized services via Docker.
* Deployed and managed applications on AWS EC2 and S3, configuring IAM roles and policies for secure access.
* Performed load, stress, and performance testing using JMeter, identifying bottlenecks and improving throughput.
* Implemented Spring Security with OAuth2.0 for authentication and authorization of REST endpoints.
* Collaborated in Agile ceremonies, sprint reviews, and peer code reviews to improve delivery quality.
Java Developer
Citi Group | Jan 2018 – Dec 2019
* Developed backend modules using Spring MVC, Spring JDBC, and Hibernate, implementing DAO and service layers following clean architecture principles.
* Integrated Kafka for message streaming, including logic for failed message reprocessing based on offset tracking.
* Implemented RESTful and SOAP web services, ensuring reliable integration with internal and external systems.
* Used JUnit and Mockito for automated testing and integrated builds via Maven and Jenkins.
* Leveraged AWS SDK for S3 data storage and SNS notifications to integrate cloud-based communication within legacy systems.
* Implemented OAuth2-based authentication to secure REST APIs and manage access control.
* Performed debugging and production issue resolution using logs and monitoring tools, ensuring minimal downtime.
